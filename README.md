# motionsensor-computing
Repository containing all matlab files for the development of motion information systems as described under www.motionsensorcomputing.com

About that project - Purpose:
Collecting and computing motion data is one part of wearable sensor based motion analysis. Implementing systems that automatically provide the motion information you want to know about another one.
Building the most interesting training applications requires expert knowledge on how to transform the motion data to retrieve useful information.

What is your goal? What do you want to do with your application? Browse our sample information retrieval applications and get inspired for your own use cases. Everybody can become a sensor expert!
